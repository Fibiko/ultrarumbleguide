In this sub-guide we will cover a bunch of smaller things that aren't deep enough to make a whole page for.

# Additional Rewards
In the Play Screen there's a button called "Notifications", here you can see both people that joined your agency and invites from other players to their party. However, sometimes you can also find rewards, mostly league rewards or from special events like anniversary, anime episode releases (mostly applies to the Vigilantes anime now).



# Primary Gamemodes: Battle Royale and Area Control
All the modes listed below use either the Battle Royale gamemode or the Area Control gamemode. To learn more about either of them click the respective button, otherwise keep scrolling!

# Mode Selection
## 3-Player Team Battle - Ranked Match (BATTLE ROYALE)
This is Ultra Rumble's competitive mode, where you can gain points from your performance and climb higher in the ranking. This mode uses Skill Based Matchmaking, so the difficulty will be adjusted to your performance. (in theory).

</p>

## 3-Player Team Battle - Unranked Match (BATTLE ROYALE)
This is the "chill" version of Ranked Match, however this is half true half false, as the lack of Skill Based Matchmaking here can pair you with top players tha tdecided to play some unranked matches, so be careful.

## 2-Player Team Battle - Unranked Match (BATTLE ROYALE)
A currently unavailable gamemode that was available from Season 2 to Season 4. It operates the same as "3-Player Team Battle - Unranked Match", but with 12 teams of two people instead of 8 teams of three people.

## Solo Battle - Unranked Match (BATTLE ROYALE)
Pretty much the same thing as the other unranked modes but with 24 teamless players. This mode has a peculiar quirk, that being the fact that the Poison Mist always ends up in the center of the map during the endgame, so every end zone is the same in this gamemode.

## 3-Player Team Battle - CPU Battle (BATTLE ROYALE)
An alternative way of playing the game, where instead of fighting real players, you fight bots. This comes with 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Hard.

</p>

## Area Control Battle - Event Match (AREA CONTROL)
A special event-only gamemode that, unlike every other gamemode, doesn't use the Battle Royale mode. Here, you form two teams of three people and compete against another two enemy teams of three for areas. Capturing these areas allows you to earn points, and whichever team has the most points when the timer ends wins.

## Custom Match - Private Match (BATTLE ROYALE)
Here you can create or join "rooms" (the latter can be done by inputting the room's ID code), spaces that can host players to make your own matches or participate in the ones organized by other people. Here you can choose which people will be in which team, as well as which people will remain on Stand by and which will simply spectate the match through the Observer Mode. The amount of things you can customize in this gamemode is quite limited. For instance, the only available mode you can choose is 3-Player Battle. You can technically make matches where there's teams of two people or one people by simply not filling all three team slots, but you will be limited to 8 teams, so if you want to simulate a solos match, only 8 people can play it.

A cool thing you can do is select which map to play on, which at first glance doesn't seem like anything crazy, but this includes past versions of current maps that are unavailable to play anywhere else but in this mode, such as the original USJ map, USJ Ver.02 and the original UA Island map.

## Training 
Training Mode is an important gamemode to test and practice combos or miscellaneouss stuff with either friends or/and the three default it comes with. You can also play as characters you don't own to test them and see if you like them, or even spare a friend in a 1v1 with these characters by enabling Friendly Fire.

In this mode, the Poison Mist will not show up, and you will respawn after being KOd. You will also find item pools around the map instead of Item Boxes.

Some of the things you can do in training mode include: Setting cooldowns to super fast recharge, enable Friendly Fire, change health regeneration so that you can use bots as punchbags (or test stuff on yourself), and make the bots stand still, dodge, go in attack mode, or make them spam a specific skill.
