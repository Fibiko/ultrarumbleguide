Himiko Toga is a technical character, which means your gameplan revolves around cycling and managing quirk cooldowns.

Where Toga differs from the other two copy characters (AFO and Monoma) is in that her complexity comes from essentially playing a whole different character and knowing how, when or if to use their abilities in a situation then swapping back to Toga at the right moments.

She is incredibly flexible and can do a lot because her presence alone can turn a fight in your favor by taking advantage of your opponents' advantages. Doing well with her is all about keeping your momentum and being on top of your decisions in the heat of battle. Whether it be scouting for a revive character to keep stock of their blood to help your own teammates or to copy an AoE character to flush out areas and split people up or even to duel someone on the same character you're confident you can play better and beat in a fight.

Toga is a character that wants to stick on to and bother one target to toy with and disrupt their attention. She shines when ambushing, being a nuisance and focusing on punishing bad plays from others - whether it be aerial targets who can't dodge your attacks, someone getting too close and entering your beta's range, catching people unaware and shooting them down with alpha or landing a gamma during the end lag of a whiffed attack all while feeling cute doing it.</br>

## Alpha Skill - Jagged Throwing Knife

Technical Toga doesn't have the strongest base kit so to use her to the best of you ability you should invest in alpha. It's where her best DPS comes from, has very far range and one of the best fire rates. It also is a beamer alpha meaning it does not knock opponents down easy, taking 20 shots before doing so.

It starts at 16 ammo at level 1 and goes to 30 at level 9. The reload is 0.5 seconds and even the penalty isn't long so you'll likely have this up whenever you need it. Bare in mind that while shooting Toga's movement is restricted and cannot jump or dash so if you want to move faster while using alpha it's important to time your strafing like: Jump left -> shoot a bit -> once you're about to land stop shooting to dash/jump again -> repeat.

The cooldown is very fast and forgiving so you should never worry about it and be very liberal with how you use it. Be mindful of not using it in moments beta would be the better option. To get the most out of it you need to know when to spray just a little or to hold the button longer which will be distinguished below.

She can excel and use this at any range but your approach will differ depending on distance.<br>

**Close Range**<br>
Ideally you don't want to alpha in close range against a lot of the cast on fair grounds or a 1v1, you should use it for kiting, duking, chasing to confirm a kill and punishing committal attacks and heavy end lag moves like for example a Shinso who's mid alpha attack on someone else, but never use this predictably, especially when against a character that has better burst damage than you or a stun/way of locking you down as it's usually a bluff you can do once you've conditioned them to be scared of you, the aim is to either kill in the moment or make them panic and run, forcing them into mid or long range which toga prefers. This gets the most use when your teammate is locked down by a stationary opponent or to 3rd party unaware targets. 

**Mid Range**<br>
This is her preferred "alpha war" range but outside of air strafing to the sides while shooting she doesn't have the best mobility while using it and this is why some matchups she shouldn't take if she can't out-aim them. Generally at this distance you want to shoot at melee characters who you out-range and anyone in their move's end lag. You can trade alphas with other beamers at this range but against higher skilled players it's not advised to do this on fair grounds and make sure you have the advantage first before doing so.

**Long Range**<br>
This is her safest distance and what she wants often, it's mainly for poking and preparing someone for a KO by whittling them down a bit so that when they bring the fight to you they'll be at a disadvantage, or to butter them up for you or your teammates to kill. She can survey and scout potential threats at this range. Her target priority at this range is generally just anyone she can hit in line of sight but ideally it goes Low HP/healing people > Someone running away > 3rd party someone fighting > everyone else. 

A general aiming tip that may or may not apply if you have aim assist is that despite the fast fire rate you still need to lead your shots when shooting afar since it's a projectile and not hitscan (the latter being hitting immediately where your crosshair is.)

All this to say that it's a very weak skill when not leveled to at least level 4 as the size increases help a significant amount.

## Beta Skill - Slasher Killer Knife

Toga's beta is a skill with good versatility being good for damage and really shines as her mobility. This is the skill you probably can get away with leveling up last most of the time, but that's playstyle dependent and you can find success with maxing it out first, but it's suggested pairing it with at least level 4 alpha and level 7 gamma. Beta is her riskiest move to get value out of so decision-making when you use this is important, but thankfully it's a rare instance of a skill that recharges while in use so it's forgiving on that front. It's recommended to not depend on this as your sole damage however, because it can be react-able and out-damaged while leaving you with less charges to run away.

It comes with 2 charges and stays the same at all levels. Along with the damage increases it gets 2 size increases at level 4 and level 9. There are two parts to this skill - the initial lunge and the run.

The lunge is a two hit slash combo and has decent tracking while Toga moves in the direction of where you're aiming. The run happens if you hold the button anytime after the lunge and it has a fixed duration unless you hit someone during it, which then time extends as long as you keep hitting people with it. The run has 500 downpower meaning it is an instant knockdown on hit so to get use out of the length it's preferable to hit multiple people and cycle through them as they get knocked down and recover. If you want to end it early you can let go of the button and toga will stop regardless of which state you're in.

**For Attacking**<br>
Toga's beta had a damage buff semi recently that reverted the nerf it got some seasons ago so it's much more viable for damage now but as a non armored move it still has risks and is best used for punishing people that whiff an attack, catching wake ups on characters who can't beat it, punishing people getting too close so you can run away then reposition or in detransform combos to maximize damage. It also has a quirk of hitting twice if the target rolled during your beta hitting them but don't get used to it happening often since it's out of your control.

**For Mobility**<br>
A lot of your vertical movement will come from jumping, aiming and using the lunge (taping the button) upwards to usually get on top of buildings and map geometry easier
The run is incredibly good at being tricky and swerving around nooks and crannies around the map when trying to lose people chasing you and pairs well after mobility charges of other characters' blood you use, most effective when used in the air so you can have options for pathing.

## Gamma Skill - Blood Sucker (Syringes)

Toga's arguably most important move and momentum starter but currently it's not advised to depend on it for your base Toga damage. It is a level hungry skill too meaning that you also can't neglect leveling it up if you want to maximize what you get out of it, get it to level 7-9 as early as possible as that's when it gets its last range increase. It deals decent damage at level 9 if all the syringes land but it can be unreliable as it's prone to missing due to obstacles, bad tracking, lag and your target's burst mobility. 

She has 2 charges at all levels to compensate for the troublesome tracking. Landing any of the syringe needles on an opponent will give Toga their blood for her to access with her Special Action. The move also has an interesting quirk where you can have only the blood sucking register but not the damage if the target rolled at the right timing.

Using gamma to the best of your ability is all about timing (and gambling). It has some notable end lag so it's not a good idea to use the move carelessly in 1v1s or at every open target the second you see them, so it's important to know how to pick and choose according to the situation. It also does not track targets well through objects or bushes. This is a quirk that likes to be used in open areas of the map as that gives the least obstructions. 

The best times to use gamma are: while you are in the air, during your opponent's end lag on one of their moves whether it be an attack or at the end of their mobility skill, if someone is stationary, or someone unaware like while looting or in another fight, during a teammate's grab or stun like strike Shigaraki gamma or Denki's Gamma for example and in selective instances as a detransform combo finisher.

A niche usage of it is to gamma people while you're stalking them to safely test which version of a character, default or skill set, you're fighting. Once you get blood the icon will tell you which role they are so you can then plan accordingly.

Gamma also has another cool use, that being the ability to shut down traps and other non-construct similar objects, these include Technical Dabi's traps, Technical Kaminari's disks and Twice Beta clones, destroying them.

## Special Action #1 - Transform
<p align="center">

</p>

By activating Special Action on a downed opponent you will finish them off and steal their quirk, taking all of their abilities and levels for yourself to use (you will NOT be able to use level cards on your stolen kit, it will remain at the same level as when you stole it), allowing you to swap to it and use it for combat, movement, or other things. 
This is the fastest kill option in the entire game, barely taking 2 seconds to finish off an opponent and it gives you an entire other moveset to use in conjunction with your own that you can swap to and from as much as you want (within a set cooldown).
Note: You will receive only the Base 3 skills of the person you finish with your Special Action: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, so you won't be able to steal their Special Actions like [Himiko Toga](https://ultrarumble.com/character/18) does.
You generally want to go after movement based quirks like [Mirio Togata](https://ultrarumble.com/character/24) or [Tsuyu Asui](https://ultrarumble.com/character/6), not damage oriented quirks like Strike Endeavor and Strike Shigaraki, since All For One has no mobility at all in his base kit. Stealing a Rapid character's kit will basically turn you into a 400HP Tank version of that character.
With that said, if you don't have a quirk you should steal the first one you can get your hands on. Regardless of what it is you will find it more useful to have a stolen quirk set than no other quirk set at all.
After the first one you can be more picky with your choices of quirks.
One mistake a lot of newer All For One players do is stealing every quirk they can get their hands on, you should be careful when stealing quirks since you can go from having a Level 9 Mirio Togata kit to a Level 2 Tomura Shigaraki, and once you steal a new one there's no going back. Keep in mind that you can only have 1 stolen quirk, stealing another will override the previous one.

It's worth noting that switching back to your base kit after placing Dabi traps with a Dabi quirk or similar will NOT cancel them, they will still remain on the field, which can be really useful for you, but also means you shouldn't let your guard down against a Dabi quirk All For One. Quirk swapping can also be used for unique combos combining All For One skills with stolen quirk skills.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

This move is surprisingly versatile; he can combo off of its last hit with relative ease. After his final melee hit you can use many stolen abilities for big damage. His Melee also has great tracking on the first hit, so as long as you’re relatively close you will be able to hit opponents pretty easily.

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

All For One does an advancing strike mid-air. It has a decent hitbox and can start combos if it hits an opponent with GP, but is otherwise rather unremarkable for offense. However, the slight momentum can be used to manipulate your mid air movement when used in conjuction with movement quirks such as Tsuyu's. Not a tool to be relied upon.
