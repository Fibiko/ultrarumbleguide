# <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">GENERAL ESSENTIALS: Terminology, I-Frames and more!</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about the essentials for a player that is moving towards the General Player category, here you will learn some useful terminology, and idk what else rn.

# Terminology
Here you will learn terminology often used by players ranging from basic to more advanced. ORdered in alphabetical order (for the first term of a pair).

- 3rd Party: Attack an enemy that is already fighting somebody else, often as a mere happenstance or to take advantage of a vulnerable enemy.
- Aggro: 
- Air Stalling: Purposefuly trying to remain in the air as long as possible, often really far above from the ground, in order to avoid being attacked or making some players lose interest in you.
- AoE: Area of Effect, the area of an attack.
- Beamers: Characters who rely primarily on projectiles, such as both Bakugos.
- Blues: GP Drinks
- DoT: Damage Over Time, for example, the Burn and Decay statuses are DoTs.
- Downpower/KV: The knockdown units an attack applies. If a character receivers 500 of these in a short enough window of time, they will be forcefully be knocked down, giving you invincibility for 1~ second or until you use an ability or melee attack.
- Flesh: When an enemy has no GP. You’ll probably hear this as “This person is flesh!”
- Greens: HP Drinks
- Hitstun: The period of time after being attacked where the player who got hit cannot do anything. The time varies depending on the move the player gets hit by.
- I-Frame: Invincibility/Invulnerability Frame, it refers to the seconds of invincibility you receive from actions such as being revived or recovering after being hit with max knockdown skills. I-frames make your character glow white.
- Kiting: Run away from an opponent while attacking to discourage chasing.
- Pinks: Full Revive Cards.
- Pity: A mechanic used in gacha games so players are guaranteed to get what they want after a certain amount of rolls has been done. In this game’s case that would be the “Exchange” system on banners.
- Punish: Let or force someone to make a mistake such as being in a bad position, using and/or missing an attack or action that leaves them open for a good amount of time, falling prey to a stun etc. for you to follow up, capitalise and attack them once they are vulnerable.
- Rainbows: Level-Up Cards (not ability cards).
- Rat/Ratting: A tactic where you purposefully hide for a large portion of the match.
- Res/Rez: Resurrection.
- Ruby/Topaz/Sapphire/Emerald/Amethyst (CardS): Refers to Strike/Assault/Rapid/Support/Technical Ability Cards respectively.
- Shields: Sometimes used as an alternative name for GP.
- Storm/Circle: The Poison Mist.
- Storm Camping: A tactic where you remain inside the Poison Mist for a long amount of time with the goal of staying there as long as your HP healing items supply makes it possible.
- Stun: Can be used to refer to hitstun, or to refer to other types of stun such as Denki Kaminari's shock paralysis or Hitoshi Shinso's Special Action.
- Thirst/Thirsting: When a player is adamant about finishing off a DOWNnd player and ignores other enemies to achieve this.
- ToD: Touch of Death, combos that can kill you even at full HP and GP.
- Teamheals: Team Recovery Items.
- Wake-Up: The action of recovering from the strong impact of an attack. More on this later.

Assault Characters can focus on defense and close-combat (like Yellow Itsuka Kendo and Yellow Eijiro Kirishima), have massive attacks that cover a wide area and are often slightly slow to execute (Yellow Endeavor, Young All For One, Mt Lady) or remain in a more neutral/all-rounder ground (Yellow Deku and Yellow Tomura Shigaraki).

</p>
Rapid Characters focus on agility and/or speed, they're often highly mobile and slippery characters that usually have an easy time moving from one place to another, and sometimes even be difficult to hit due to their agility or staying in the air for long.

- 1 Rapid Party Member: x1.05 Speed Boost
- 2 Rapid Party Members: x1.10 Speed Boost

</p>
Support Characters focus on interrupting the enemy with abilities that easily stop their movement and/or abilities to block exits, as well as often possessing other helpful skills like healing (Overhaul) or resurrection (Ibara, Cementoss) skills. Keep in mind that even though these characters have support characteristics, they very well work as competent damage dealers, sometimes even performing better than characters in the Strike Class. Carrying characters with this class gives the whole party a Recovery Item Effect Boost that increases the amount of healing you receive from recovery items and grows higher the more characters with this class are on the team.<br>
