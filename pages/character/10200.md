Ibara is a support-class character with a unique twist: she usually operates like a heavy sniper. Your objective is to keep enemies away from you and your team using your Alpha ability, hold key positions on the map, and turn the tide of battle with instant revives.<br>
<br>
As a key member of your team, and a non-mobility character, you will often be targeted by enemies, but with your large HP pool and high close-range Beta damage, you have every chance to stand your ground against even the strongest characters in the game.

Ibara's Alpha skill is a truly unique and powerful long-range attack. This ability features two firing modes: un-aimed and aimed.
The attack's uniqueness lies in the short-lived residual effect it leaves behind. Any enemy who steps or flies into it takes the full damage of the Alpha ability.

**Un-aimed Mode**<br>
In un-aimed mode, Ibara will spread her vines across a wide area with okay range, however, this version is significantly less likely to hit enemies, partly due to the gaps between each of her vines, and it's highly discourage to use this version of alpha against aerial targets, as the spread doesn't help much. This version is excellent for controlling chokepoints like doors and stairways, denying areas in rooms, or exposing enemies hiding in smoke or bushes, so for these situations un-aimed mode should be used.

</p>

**Aimed Mode**<br>
Most of the time, your focus should be on the aimed mode rather un-aimed. In this mode, Ibara will fire a concentrated vine shot that deals high damage and has much longer range than her un-aimed version, and is also both ideal to hit air targets and a significantly more reliable version. Furthermore, two ticks of the alpha ability are guaranteed to knock enemies back, allowing you to maintain a safe distance, prevent an enemy from escaping, or shake a threat off your teammate.

**Barrier Piercing**<br>
A crucial feature of Ibara's Alpha is its ability to pierce through enemies and many of their defensive mechanisms. This allows it to damage multiple opponents in a line, even if they are protected by shields. Below there is a list of skills that Ibara's Alpha can pierce through.

It's important to remember that some defensive mechanisms are considered terrain and cannot be pierced by Ibarra's Alpha. These include all of Cementoss's structures, Shoto Todoroki's ice walls and icicles, Momo's shield in deployed state, and Full Bullet’s Gamma. When colliding with these obstacles, Ibara's Alpha will attempt to move around them or over them, following the same rules as with any map geometry.

**Mastering your Alpha: Feel The Flow**<br>
Ibara's Alpha is a finicky yet fascinating ability with incredibly diverse interactions with map terrain. Unleash your imagination and head into training mode. Start shooting at everything you see and observe the Alpha's behavior. It is far from intuitive, especially for a new player. Below are examples of some of the most common interactions.

</p>

**Trajectory Thinking**<br>
A vital step towards fully mastering Ibara's Alpha is to start thinking in terms of its trajectory. Recall how you play other characters. Most often, a character's Alpha skill is a projectile resembling a sphere—a single point that must directly connect with an enemy's hitbox.

With Ibara's Alpha, however, you are not firing a point, but an entire line that persists in the air for a short time. Simply put, you don't need to aim directly at the enemy's model. It's often enough to shoot at their feet, and the Alpha will extend to reach them. If an enemy is climbing a wall, you can shoot at its base. If they are flying through the air, you can create a barrier in their path that they will fly into.

**Accept the Randomness**<br>
Ibara's Alpha can be random. This is barely visible in aimed mode but you can clearly see it in un-aimed mode. Randomness causes unintended behavior that is simply beyond your control. Sometimes it favours you, sometimes it doesn’t.
IdkWhatKindOfGifImSupposedToPutHereTho

**Value your ammo**
Even at level 9, Ibara only has 4 Alpha charges. At level 1, she has a mere 2. Every shot is a chance to deal up to 160 damage (depending on your level) and knock an enemy back. Every miss leaves you vulnerable and allows enemies to close the distance.

The cost of any mistake on a low-mobility character is incredibly high. Treat every miss as a significant mechanical error. Dedicate yourself to training your accuracy and constantly improving. Most importantly, avoid situations where you spend all your Alpha charges in the heat of battle and are left with none.

## Beta Skill - Via Dolorosa
<p align="center">

Toga's beta is a skill with good versatility being good for damage and really shines as her mobility. This is the skill you probably can get away with leveling up last most of the time, but that's playstyle dependent and you can find success with maxing it out first, but it's suggested pairing it with at least level 4 alpha and level 7 gamma. Beta is her riskiest move to get value out of so decision-making when you use this is important, but thankfully it's a rare instance of a skill that recharges while in use so it's forgiving on that front. It's recommended to not depend on this as your sole damage however, because it can be react-able and out-damaged while leaving you with less charges to run away.

It comes with 2 charges and stays the same at all levels. Along with the damage increases it gets 2 size increases at level 4 and level 9. There are two parts to this skill - the initial lunge and the run.

The lunge is a two hit slash combo and has decent tracking while Toga moves in the direction of where you're aiming. The run happens if you hold the button anytime after the lunge and it has a fixed duration unless you hit someone during it, which then time extends as long as you keep hitting people with it. The run has 500 downpower meaning it is an instant knockdown on hit so to get use out of the length it's preferable to hit multiple people and cycle through them as they get knocked down and recover. If you want to end it early you can let go of the button and toga will stop regardless of which state you're in.

</p>

**For Attacking**<br>
Toga's beta had a damage buff semi recently that reverted the nerf it got some seasons ago so it's much more viable for damage now but as a non armored move it still has risks and is best used for punishing people that whiff an attack, catching wake ups on characters who can't beat it, punishing people getting too close so you can run away then reposition or in detransform combos to maximize damage. It also has a quirk of hitting twice if the target rolled during your beta hitting them but don't get used to it happening often since it's out of your control.

**For Mobility**<br>
A lot of your vertical movement will come from jumping, aiming and using the lunge (taping the button) upwards to usually get on top of buildings and map geometry easier
The run is incredibly good at being tricky and swerving around nooks and crannies around the map when trying to lose people chasing you and pairs well after mobility charges of other characters' blood you use, most effective when used in the air so you can have options for pathing.

## Gamma Skill - Blood Sucker (Syringes)
<p align="center">

</p>

Toga's arguably most important move and momentum starter but currently it's not advised to depend on it for your base Toga damage. It is a level hungry skill too meaning that you also can't neglect leveling it up if you want to maximize what you get out of it, get it to level 7-9 as early as possible as that's when it gets its last range increase. It deals decent damage at level 9 if all the syringes land but it can be unreliable as it's prone to missing due to obstacles, bad tracking, lag and your target's burst mobility. 

She has 2 charges at all levels to compensate for the troublesome tracking. Landing any of the syringe needles on an opponent will give Toga their blood for her to access with her Special Action. The move also has an interesting quirk where you can have only the blood sucking register but not the damage if the target rolled at the right timing.

Using gamma to the best of your ability is all about timing (and gambling). It has some notable end lag so it's not a good idea to use the move carelessly in 1v1s or at every open target the second you see them, so it's important to know how to pick and choose according to the situation. It also does not track targets well through objects or bushes. This is a quirk that likes to be used in open areas of the map as that gives the least obstructions. 

The best times to use gamma are: while you are in the air, during your opponent's end lag on one of their moves whether it be an attack or at the end of their mobility skill, if someone is stationary, or someone unaware like while looting or in another fight, during a teammate's grab or stun like strike Shigaraki gamma or Denki's Gamma for example and in selective instances as a detransform combo finisher.

A niche usage of it is to gamma people while you're stalking them to safely test which version of a character, default or skill set, you're fighting. Once you get blood the icon will tell you which role they are so you can then plan accordingly.

## Special Action #1 - Transform
<p align="center">

</p>

Toga's special is the most important part of her kit and what her gameplan comes back to. To transform once you get blood you press the special button and to detransform you press crouch twice quickly. You can act immediately after detransforming. Important to note that toga detransforming with her AoE or Traps active from a character she copied (Tech Dabi for example) become only visual with no damage or disappear.

Transforming has many reasons such as using another character's strengths that toga can take advantage of like AoE characters to control space, revive characters to keep your team alive, mobile characters either to chase or run and so on. She also can transform and detransform quickly to reset her own cooldowns if staying as base toga is preferable in that situation.

A lot of the difficulty in playing her comes from knowing how to play other characters efficiently. It's recommended you have a good understanding on how to play the whole roster but you don't have to master them all. When looking to transform you should value how confident you are in playing the character over just their strength, I advise having 3-6 characters in your pocket that you play well and play reliably to get the most use out of them.

The biggest double-edged sword however is that the enemy you copy and their team have you highlighted so you can use it to your advantage and confuse them but in practice it's easy to point to you and single out who's who, this is why unless the character you copy is good at handling multiple people or you can escape from them it's not advisable to transform if you have a whole team's attention on you- instead try do so during chaos and diversions like 3rd partying or your teammates taking attention if your aim is to disorientate people. Another option is to kill that person and use their blood in a fight with another team so you get the benefit of transforming without being traceable. Just don't forget that while you're transformed, your location is visible at all times by the team you stole blood from.

Lastly, Toga generally would prefer to play transformations out as long as she can before detransforming due to below average dps on her kit outside of alpha but don't get too attached to your blood either and detransform if you have to.

## Special Action #2 - Blood Sucker (Direct-Drinking)

</p>

Toga has a second special action that's a stab that can be used on downed bodies, it gives you their blood and puts your Special Action on a short cooldown. It won't see a lot of use unless you were struggling to get the blood with gamma.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A simple 3-hit melee on the ground that has short range but good speed. You won't be in the position to use this a lot of the time as Toga wants to keep distance but it is a good wake-up catching tool and you can time each press a little slower to account for when your opponent's i-frames end. This also combos well into beta and with the addition of tuning it doesn't hurt to know some detransform into melee combos.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1800m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

A simple 1 hit slash in the air that probably gets better use as mobility aid than as an attack. Using it after a jump can increase your travel distance slightly but when really high up it's useful for air strafing.
